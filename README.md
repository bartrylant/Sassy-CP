Sassy CP
==============================================================

This is not a theme that completely overhauls the ExpressionEngine control panel. Rather, it is a series of tweaks to make the experience better. This removes the pink from the CP and tidies up a few areas throughout the system.

Installation
-----------

* Navigate to your "themes/cp_themes" folder.
* Add the "sassy_cp" folder in to the "cp_themes" folder.
* Open "system/expressionengine/config/config.php" and add " $config['cp_theme'] = 'sassy_cp'; "
* Your control panel should now have the override applied.

Pre v1.1.0 Updating
-----------

If you are using a version prior to v.1.1.0, follow these steps to update.

* Navigate to "themes/cp_themes/default/css".
* Delete "override.css".
* Follow "Installation Instructions" above.
